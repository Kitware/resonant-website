<h3>Girder</h3>
<h4>Data Management</h4>

<p>
    Data from the real world is complex, irregular, and gritty - before you can extract insight from it you need to be able to
    store it, clean it, and query it. Girder is Resonant’s data management platform that stores your data securely, lets
    your browse and share it using the web, and empowers you to build your own web applications around your data using an
    expressive RESTful API and client libraries.
</p>

<p> At Kitware, we use an instance of Girder to host a publicly accessible data store at
    <a target=_blank href=https://data.kitware.com>https://data.kitware.com</a>. You can head over there right now to try it out. </p>

<p> We have also developed several Girder-based web applications to serve our customers’ data ingestion and storage needs. These
    applications often form a full customer solution, offering a user interface to the customer’s data and a jumping-off
    point for performing various analytics and visualizations related to their specific problem. For the
    <a target=_blank
        href=https://challenge.kitware.com/>COVALIC project</a>, we created a Girder-backed application for hosting grand challenges - users can log in, download
    sample data, and upload their solutions to the challenge problems, which are then evaluated using Resonant analytics.
    Girder works in the background to organize and store all the data, and coordinate the analytics, while the web application
    presents a crisp, clean experience to visitors. </p>

<p> Another example is the
    <a target=_blank href=https://isic-archive.com/>ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration)
    </a> Archive, a project that aims to collect images of skin lesions in one place so that research dermatologists can
    use image annotation and other techniques to advance the fight against skin cancer. </p>

<p> In other cases, the application is simply an extension to the standard Girder user interface -  the Monkeybrains plugin is
    one such example, introducing a chart and explanation to a stored dataset: </p>

<p> You can think of Girder as not just a data management tool, but a whole platform for creating web applications powered by
    your data. </p>
