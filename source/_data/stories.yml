      As part of the Department of Energy-funded project <a href="http://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/hurricanes/">ClimatePipes</a>,
      we created an interactive map
      to help scientists studying geoinformatics track historic hurricane paths. The map uses GeoJS’
      geospatial visualization capabilities to display hurricanes in different colors based on category.
      You can explore the hurricanes by date, wind speed, and surface pressure, using pan-and-zoom
      capabilities to focus on specific regions of the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of our commitment to open source, we provide source code for creating features such as
      a map object and a legend. Source code is also available for drawing the map and loading the
      data.

  description: <p>Using data from 114 million taxi and bike trips, we created a
    live application that allows you to search taxi and bike trip data in New York City, Washington D.C., and Boston and analyze population
    movements. You can filter results by pick-up date, trip distance, and number of
    passengers; display results for pick-up and drop-off locations using various tile sets including
    MapQuest Satellite and OpenStreetMap; pan and zoom; and animate results. In the link below, watch
    how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_11%E2%80%9317,_2014_North_American_winter_storm">February 2014 winter storm</a>

    days it took before the city returned to its natural rhythm.</p>

- name: ebola
  displayName: Ebola Outbreak
  subtitle: Storytelling with data
  description: <p>In order to increase awareness of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in western Africa, we developed an interactive visualization timeline. The timeline aggregates news, case count information, and a
    generational disease outbreak model. It is broken down into two infographics. The first
    represents news articles related to the outbreak, where each node on the timeline is linked to a
    corresponding news report. The second depicts outbreak cases over the same date range.
    Controls allow you to choose whether this information is displayed as a hypothetical tree
    showing transmission links or graphed by the sum of cases reported over time (in total or broken down per country).</p>
    <p>In addition to the timeline, we created a map to visualize a live Twitter stream related to the
    outbreak in a geospatial context. The map uses Tangelo's streaming data services to retrieve
    Tweets containing the hashtag “Ebola.” GeoJS then plots the Tweets.
    The Air Force Research Laboratory and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
    XDATA program sponsored the effort to create the timeline and the map, while HealthMap
    provided the news articles used in the timeline.</p>

  displayName: Hospital Costs
  subtitle: Interactive visualization
  description: <p>When outcome and cost metrics for thousands of hospitals were released by the federal
    government, we sought to answer the question, “Does hospital cost relate to the quality of patient
    outcome?” As part of an effort sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Defense
    Advanced Research Projects Agency XDATA program, we developed an interactive online
    visualization tool that allows you to compare the cost of treatments for pneumonia and heart
    failure, the amount of Medicare reimbursement received, and the quality of care for hospitals
    throughout the country.</p>
    <p>The online visualization tool is built on the Tangelo web framework. Using this tool, you can
    select different states, highlight particular hospitals, and toggle between a bar chart and a scatter
    plot to see how your local hospital stacks up to national averages.</p>

    for data organization, dissemination, authentication, and management. The Harlow Center for
    Biological Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Neuro Image Research
    and Analysis Laboratories (NIRAL) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill compiled

  subtitle: Bioinformatics workflows
  description: <p>The Resonant Flow application was primarily developed for the National Science Foundation
    (NSF) <a href="http://arborworkflows.com/">Arbor Revolutionary Workflows</a> project, which provides new ways for phylogenetics
    researchers to share code and data, as well as to educate others on new methods. Resonant Flow
    allows you to drag and drop data, author and run analytic scripts in R or Python, construct
    complex bioinformatics workflows, and visualize results in a browser. The application uses
    Girder to store both data and analyses and to manage the remote execution of analyses through
    Celery, a popular Python framework for distributed task management. Resonant Flow also uses
    GeoJS to plot the locations of the observations for a better understanding of the geographic
    distribution of species.</p>

  description: <p>The SUMO collective laboratory works on problems of computational biology while
    leveraging methods from bioinformatics, visualization, and image analysis. The
    group, led by Ohio State University, has engineered several workflows for
    processing and analyzing images for problems in cancer, neuro, and wound biology
    and immunology. They have developed algorithms that have been adapted for
    exploration in the laboratory at the microscopic scale (confocal, brightfield,
    histology, etc.) and in radiology clinics (diffusion tensor MR, fMRI, etc.).
    Kitware has assisted this group with developing online software to share these
    algorithms and visualizations to a wide audience. The SUMO software enables
    researchers to analyze data through a web interface supported by Girder and
    Girder Worker.</p>

  description: <p>
    Funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the XDATA project aims to
    develop Big Data analysis and visualization solutions by using and expanding open-source
    frameworks. The project is comprised of dozens of interactive, visual web applications. XDATA
    helps you to see patterns, map fields to visuals, search for anomalies, follow a network, link
    database queries to visual information, and document entity relationships. For example, you can
    find and filter data from Bitcoin, Akamai, or Twitter; explore the progression of table
    partitioning in a predictive database; visualize large graphs using the Biofabric algorithm; track
    theft; search for relationships among emails from Enron employees; and discover locations from
    millions of photographs on Flickr.
    </p>
    <p>
    XDATA is hosted on the modular and flexible structure of Tangelo, which rapidly creates the
    interactive, visual web applications using a variety of data sources. Girder manages the large
    XDATA datasets, and Girder Worker creates workflows for the extract, transform, and load (ETL)
    data tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
    Several of the Resonant examples on this site were built using XDATA technologies.

  description: <p>Our COVALIC platform helps you get the most out of your data, while saving millions of dollars
    in research and development. The platform unites datasets and software from world-class
    researchers and developers for grand challenges. During grand challenges, participants submit
    results to well-defined inputs and outputs. These results are scored against a known ground-truth
    and ranked. The outcome of grand challenges is win-win data analysis, as stakeholders can
    discover solutions from algorithm developers in their fields, and developers can see how their
    methods work on real-world data. Thus, grand challenges help solve problems, advance the sate-
    of-the-art, and evaluate novel algorithms through community competition.
    The COVALIC platform combines decades of high-performance computing and medical
    imaging experience with our modern data and analytics framework. The platform submits data to
    Girder, processes it with Girder Worker, and visualizes the results using Tangelo.</p>
